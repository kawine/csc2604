Regular:

M1 -0.1027
M1_plus -0.715
M2_10 0.0
M2_50 0.0
M2_100 0.0

The correlation is very poor with the LSA vectors because for the words tested,
the vectors are almost zero vectors -- so rarely do they appear in the co-occurrence
matrix. To take a small step at fixing this, I do add-one smoothing, which improves
performance to a surprising extent.


Bonus (add-one smoothing):

M1 -0.311
M1_plus -0.202
M2_10 -0.128
M2_50 0.262
M2_100 0.696
